# Privacy Policy

Effective date: May 19, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how your personal data is collected, used, and protected by our Android application ("the app", "we", "us", or "our"). The app helps users visualize personal struggles as “monsters” that they battle daily through gamified challenges.

---

### 1. Information We Collect

We collect only the data necessary to operate the core features of the app:

#### a. Google Sign-In
If you choose to sign in using Google, we collect your name, email address, and profile picture to personalize your experience and securely associate your data.

#### b. Monster Metadata
You can create "monsters" that represent personal struggles or habits. Metadata such as monster name, type, and status is stored securely on our servers to support app functionality.

#### c. Encrypted Monster Meaning (End-to-End Encrypted)
Each monster’s personal meaning is **encrypted on your device using a PIN you set**. This encrypted data is uploaded to our servers to avoid it being lost, but it is **never visible to us** in any form.

- The PIN is never transmitted to us and is **only known to you**.
- If the PIN is lost, **we cannot recover the encrypted data**.

#### d. App Usage Metrics (Anonymous)
We may collect anonymized, aggregated data such as feature usage frequency or challenge outcomes — never linked to your identity.

---

### 2. How We Use Your Data

- To personalize your experience and store progress
- To allow recovery of encrypted data via cloud backup (with your PIN)
- To improve the app through aggregated anonymous analytics

---

### 3. Data Storage & Encryption

- **All sensitive data ("monster meaning") is end-to-end encrypted** using a PIN that only you know.
- We **do not and cannot decrypt** this content.
- Loss of your PIN results in permanent loss of access to the associated encrypted data.

---

### 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data. All storage is secured, and access is limited strictly to authorized systems for essential app functions.

---

### 5. Your Rights

- You may delete your account and associated data at any time.
- You may export or back up your data within the app.
- You are responsible for maintaining your PIN for encrypted data access.
