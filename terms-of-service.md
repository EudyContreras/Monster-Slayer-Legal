# Terms of Service

Effective date: May 19, 2025

Welcome to our Android app ("Monsters"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the app, which allows you to gamify personal challenges by visualizing them as monsters you can battle daily.

### 1. Eligibility

You must be 13 years of age or older to use the app. 

---

### 2. Your Responsibilities

- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and PIN.
- You agree to use the app in a lawful and respectful manner.

---

### 3. End-to-End Encryption

The app offers **mandatory end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** for any sensitive personal meaning attached to monsters.

- You are required to set a PIN, which is used to encrypt this data locally before it is stored remotely.
- This encrypted content **cannot be decrypted** by us — even if requested.
- If you lose your PIN, **your encrypted data is permanently inaccessible**.

This design ensures your privacy but places full responsibility for PIN retention on you.
